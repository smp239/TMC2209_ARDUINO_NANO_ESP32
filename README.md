# TMC_2209_ESP32 and Micropython
This is a library to drive a stepper motor with a TMC2209 stepper driver and a LOLIN32 V1.0.0 ESP32 Board.
The code has been tested with MicroPython and should also run on the Arduino
Nano ESP32 when flashed with the MicroPython firmware.  In that case you may
need to adapt the UART pins used to communicate with the driver (see
``TMC_2209`` constructor).

This is a clone off the great work from Chr157i4n, thank you for the time you spend !

This code is still experimental, so use it on your own risk.
i have not tested all functions, hope its a start for others.
